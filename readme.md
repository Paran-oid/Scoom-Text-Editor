# TODO

## section 1

- Implement redo and undo functionalities (using stacks for both redo, undo and storing older snapshots somehow)
- Enable strict debugging stuff again

## section 2

- Make it resize itself when terminal window gets resized or something like that (ask chatgpt for edge cases like these after)
- Add more error handling
- Document my code.
- Once done with the project, enable the hashed strict flags in CMakefile.
